# Learn the BotFramework V4

In this repository we will go through exercises taken from our Bot Framework "[Chat-bot-in-a-Day](https://www.orange-networks.com/products/ai)" Workshop.

They exercises are designed to build up and gradually introduce new concepts from: 
* Starting with a simple ASP.NET Web Application.
* Adding dependencies so that the bot replies, 
* Adding libraries that take the heavy-lifting of maintaining conversation state.
* Replying with Rich Media.
